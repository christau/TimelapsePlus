This application is a branch from application "Timelapse!" (`com.explorerdc.timelapse`), which was written by the developer ExplorerDC (no specific names), but abandoned in 2011. The [last post in his blog](http://explorerdc.blogspot.ru/) was published on September 28, 2011 stating that "version 1.3 will be released soon," but there were no subsequent updates to the application.

After 6.5 years, I decided to take APK, decompile it and compile my own modification of this application.
